# gr-robotics
gr-robotics adds automation to the GNU Radio framework by providing interfaces with GPIO, USB peripherals, and other sensors &amp; actuators.

# Project Roadmap
The following is our notional roadmap and likely ot change as needs and opportunities come up. We are open to contributors adding capabilities not included in the roadmap.

## Raspberry Pi
Our first hardware target is the GPIO of the Raspberri Pi 2 - 4. This includes general IO, PWM, I2C, SPI, and Serial capabilities.

## FT232H
The second hardware target is a general purpose USB to GPIO board to enable rapid prototyping on computers without integrated GPIO.
